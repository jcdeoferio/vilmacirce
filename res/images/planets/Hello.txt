Hi.
This planetary map is copyright of Dan North.
I usually check my email at Dannorth@bigpond.com
If you use this map in any images- please tell me- I would love to see them! :)
If you put it in any images on the web please give me a credit or else if I ever find you
I will hunt you down. Asteroids don't concern me...



Anyway, enjoy,

Dan.
